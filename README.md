These codes can help you to calculate the electron scattering phase shifts and cross sections.

## Usage
---------------------

If you want to get results similar to the report, you can run each file directly.

--For Example--

Run fig1_PlotYukawa.py
Then, you can get the result of Figure 1.

--The other Example--

Run fig2-3_tab2_SaxonWoodsComplex.py
Then, you can get the results of Figure 2, Figure3, and Table 2.

## Development environment
